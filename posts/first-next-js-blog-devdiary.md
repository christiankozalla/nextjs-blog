## My first Blog made with Next.js

In this post I'll walk you through each step of creating my first Blog with Next.js, React, style-jsx and Markdown. Each step is supplemented by Code Snippets and detailed description. I am aiming to inspire anyone seeking to create their own Blog! First, I want to start you off with a simple truth I learnt while programming every day for the past months:

> _"If you want to succeed, double your failure rate._"  
>  Thomas J. Watson, former CEO of IBM

Since I, myself was heavily inspired by two existing blogs especially in the early stage of creating my own, I'd like to say **Thank You!** Please, take a look at [leerob.io](https://leerob.io) and [christianalfoni.com](https://christianalfoni.com) whose blogs are open source on GitHub as well!

The birth of my _DevDiary_ started with one single command.

```js
$ npx create-next-app
```
