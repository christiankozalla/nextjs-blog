# 9 Amazing GitHub Repos for Every Developer

Since GitHub is **huge** and hard to grasp with the naked eye, I have collected 9 of the most amazing repos out there. These are handy resources for every Programmer seeking to enhance their skills in Web Development.

## :one: [Free For Dev](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/amazing-github-repos-for-every-web-developer/free-for-dev.png" alt="Free For Dev GitHub Repo" width="100%" />
</p>

As a Developer you often find yourself confronted with the need to use a third-party service like a Database, a CMS, Analytics, Payment, and more .. down to plain ol' Web Hosting. Whether to compare the major cloud providers or something more specific - this curated list got you covered! **[Free For Dev](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) helps you making _informed decisions_** what service to go with by listing a variety of _as-a-Service Solutions_ offering a **free tier for at least a year or more!** Check it out if you're seeking a service for your project! :fire:

## :two: [Frontend Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/amazing-github-repos-for-every-web-developer/frontend-checklist.png" alt="Frontend Checklist GitHub Repo" width="100%" />
</p>

The Frontend Checklist is an _amazing_ resource you can consult everytime before launching a website getting a project ready for production! Simply browse the list to check whether all required elements are implemented into your website. Some elements are recommended, some _can't be omitted_, which is highlighted with corresponding colors next to the tool/element.

When I read through the Frontend Checklist first, I even fixed some elements on my own blog [Devdiary](https://devdiary.me), and found useful tools like the [SERP Snipped Generator](https://app.sistrix.com/en/serp-snippet-generator), the [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) or [Wave Testing](https://wave.webaim.org/) for Accessibility.

It's an invaluable list across HTML, CSS, JS and Best Practices :heart_eyes:

## :three: [Build Your Own X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x)

Have you ever wondered _how the software you're using daily works?_ If yes, this is the perfect repo to find software to re-build in order to learn how it works! Just replace _X_ with the technology you want to learn. :rainbow:

Lately, I was thinking about what's happening while using a frontend framework _under the hood._ Plus, because I'm a _hands-on kinda guy_, I like a practical approach when trying to understand something in depth. I found the perfect tutorial for [re-building React myself](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) on the _build-your-own-X_. :tada:

Check out for yourself, what your building _next!_ :fire:

## :four: [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/amazing-github-repos-for-every-web-developer/publicAPI.png" alt="Public API GitHub Repo" width="100%" />
</p>

This repo is a _vast_ resource of free APIs for nearly every purpose you can imagine. Starting with _Animals_ listing APIs about cute pics of cats, dogs and what else, up to _Weather_.. and everything in between! It's very handy to get a broad overview of the available free APIs and to find out if they support HTTPS or if you need API keys for authentication. :smiley_cat:

## :five: [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/amazing-github-repos-for-every-web-developer/html5-boilerplate.png" alt="HTML5 Boilerplate GitHub Repo" width="100%" />
</p>

This is a professional template to give you a quick start with your next website project! :fire: [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) has its own website from which you can start off, but it allows for several other starting points:

- `git clone https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate.git` - and checkout the specific release you want to use
- `npm install html5-boilerplate` OR `yarn add html5-boilerplate` - as a node module
- the new [create-html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/create-html5-boilerplate) solutions - run `npx create-html5-boilerplate new-site` :tada:

## :six: [Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)

With over 160k GitHub stars this repos provides the most astonishing list of free programming books categorized by language! :books:

Have fun browsing the list and even more fun reading! :book:

## :seven: [30 Seconds of Code](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/amazing-github-repos-for-every-web-developer/30-seconds-of-code.png" alt="30 Seconds of Code GitHub Repo" width="95%" />
</p>

_30 Seconds of Code_ is full of Short JavaScript code snippets for all your development needs! You can search for snippets on their corresponding website [30secondsofcode.org](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/)! Inside the snippet list you'll find many valuable posts not only JavaScript and React, but CSS and Phython, too. :sunny:

## :eight: [The Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/amazing-github-repos-for-every-web-developer/developer-roadmap.png" alt="Developer Roadmap GitHub Repo" width="95%" />
</p>

The Developer Roadmap is especially interesting for young developers just starting their journey. When I was completely new to web development, I remember feeling a bit lost in the dark when reading through articles or learning new technologies. I sometimes wished for a broad overhead view on the whole picture mapping out each path - just to know where I was located on my journey, right now.

The Developer Roadmap's got you covered showing you every direction and destination possible in Web Development both frontend and backend! :+1:

## :nine: [GitHub Emoji Cheatsheet](https://github.com/catdad/github-emoji-cheatsheet)

I used that one alot throughout this post! :smile: Several days ago, my [blog](https://devdiary.me) didn't support parsing emojis like `:smile:` from markdown.. :grimacing:

But a nice remark plugin called [remark-emoji](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-emoji) made it happend! :tada::tada::tada:

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading through! :heart: I hope you found something interesting here and there in this vast ocean of code called GitHub. If you have any feedback on this post, please let me know!
