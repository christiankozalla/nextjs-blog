# Developer's Resume Template - made with Tailwind, Vite and Ionicons

This is a template for you if you want to put your resume online to share it easily with future employers or clients!

I've made the resume template with

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Next Generation of Frontend Tooling
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com) - Open source icons. Lovingly hand-crafted.

## Resources to start

Instructions on how to get the template working for your can be found along with the **[Code on GitHub](https://github.com/christiankozalla/dev-resume-template)**

> **[Live Resume Example](https://christiankozalla.github.io/dev-resume-template/)**

## Story behind

I've redesigned my resume from the ground up, lately. I was tired of keeping a Word / PDF document always up-to-date. In addition, I enjoyed the simplicity of updating websites just by pushing new code to a repository! Plus, a website offers a lot more freedom to style and design according to your likes.

I thought of several advantages of building my resume as a website instead of a PDF:

- Responsive - A website looks great on all screen sizes
- Every design is possible - CSS offers an abundant variety
- Easily share the link with friends, employers or clients

> Another nice side-effect: I was waiting for an opportunity to try some tools and libraries like Tailwind and Vite. So my need for a new resume was a perfect match in this case! :smile:
